# Project Overview:
The goal of our project is to use the New York City Census Data to create two sensible models for median household income and income per capita in NYC and the surrounding area. 
We are going to use analytical approaches, Stepwise Selection and Shrinkage Methods to select subset of predictors. Using the variables selected, we are going to perform multiple linear regression to model median household income and income per capita as a linear combination of the potential predictors. Multiple linear regression is a useful statistical model for predicting a response on the basis of multiple redactor variables. 
Starting from that baseline model, we are going to add interaction terms and perform transformation on variables based on exploratory analysis and diagnosis from the model.

# Data Overview:	 	 	 					
The New York City Census Data is from the 2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates by census tracts with 2167 observations. For each census tract, 36 properties and demographic information were collected, for example total population, % under poverty level, median household income, unemployment rate and etc. Using supplementary census tract location data, we are able to show the distribution of income level on New York Map.
